    Keysight's 5G LoadCore test solution addresses critical validation requirements for improved reliability and performance of 5G emerging architectures. With comprehensive performance testing of all nodes and interfaces, this powerful yet easy-to-use solution helps network operators deliver higher-performing services, greater scale, and lower-latency communications.
    Using real-world subscriber modeling, testers do not need to be protocol experts to develop realistic test scenarios. From a single application, perform capacity tests, detail a device’s throughput, measure voice and video quality, and model a wide variety of mobility scenarios.

    With 5G development and adoption progressing rapidly, cloud native is central to the 5GC architecture. With its microservice architecture and options to be deployed either as a virtual machine (VM) or Container, LoadCore is fully aligned to this new paradigm.

    **Highlights**

    * Test the 4G/5G Core Network by simulating multiple nodes and interfaces, from end-toend to node isolation.
    * Simulate UE behavior in multiple 4G/5G use cases like network slicing, multi-access edge computing (MEC) low latency and offloading, video optimization.
    * Scale up to millions of subscribers with high data throughput, using stateful application traffic mixes that can interact with real servers and peers.
    * Perform service quality validation with subscriber modeling, multiplay traffic, and quality of experience (QoE) measurements.
    * Validate complex scenarios for service-based architecture (SBA)
    * Control test traffic mix and intensity using network objectives to independently manage control and user planes.
    * Deploy either as VM or containers on private, hybrid or public clouds. High flexibility in terms of supported platform, hypervisor and orchestration.
    * Available through AWS Marketplace either as BYOL (Bring Your Own License) or PAYG (Pay As You Go) – an industry first.
    * Full automation via REST API and Python allows users to create regressions for continuous validation of product quality.
    * Predefined test suites for 3GPP 5G Security Assurance Specification (SCAS) conformance validation.
    * Fuzzing testing capability on SBI interfaces.

    **Note**: This appliance TNLCM backend uses a MONGO database, so the VM needs to be virtualized with a CPU model that supports AVX instructions. The default CPU model in the template is host_passthrough, but if you are interested in VM live migration,
    change it to a CPU model similar to your host's CPU that supports [x86-64v2 or higher](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/qemu-cpu-models.html).
