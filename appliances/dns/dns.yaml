description: |-
  This appliance installs Technitium DNS, an open source authoritative as well as recursive DNS server that can be used for self hosting a DNS server for privacy & security.

  The image is based on an Ubuntu 22.04 cloud image with the OpenNebula [contextualization package](http://docs.opennebula.io/6.6/management_and_operations/references/kvm_contextualization.html).

  After deploying the appliance, you can check the status of the deployment in `/etc/one-appliance/status`, or deployment logs in `/var/log/one-appliance/`.

  The appliance configuration can be customized via parameters:

  * `ONEAPP_DNS_PASSWORD` - Admin user password. If not provided, a new one will be generated at instanciate time with `openssl rand -base64 32`.
  * `ONEAPP_DNS_FORWARDERS` - Comma separated list of forwarders to be used by the DNS server.
  * `ONEAPP_DNS_DOMAIN` - Domain name for creating the new zone.

  **Note**: This appliance does not permit recontextualization. Modifying the context variables will not have any real efects on the running instance.
