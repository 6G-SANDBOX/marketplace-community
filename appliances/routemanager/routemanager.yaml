description: |-
  This appliance installs the latest version of [route-manager-api](https://github.com/6G-SANDBOX/route-manager-api), a REST API in port 8172/tcp developed with FastAPI for managing network routes on a Linux machine using the ip command.

  The image is based on Debian 12 with the OpenNebula [contextualization package](http://docs.opennebula.io/6.6/management_and_operations/references/kvm_contextualization.html) installed.

  After deploying the appliance, check the status of the deployment in `/etc/one-appliance/status`, or deployment logs in `/var/log/one-appliance/`.

  The appliance configuration can be customized with the following parameters:

  * `ONEAPP_ROUTEMANAGER_APITOKEN` - Bearer token to authenticate to the API. If not provided, a new one will be generated at instanciate time with `openssl rand -base64 32`.
  
  **Note**: Remember to add a password variable in the template in order to have access to it, or make sure that your OpenNebula user has an SSH Public key preconfigured.
