***
This report is generated by the Robot Framework and contains the basic information of the appliance.

## **System Summary**

| Virtual Machine Info | |
|---|---|
| **Test Date** | {{timestamp}} |
| **Appliance Name** | {{hostname}} |
| **OS Version** | {{os_details}} |

&nbsp;
## **CPU Information**
This section provides detailed information about the CPU of the appliance, including the model, number of physical and logical cores, and per-core usage statistics.
| CPU specs |  |
|---|---|
| **CPU Model** | {{cpu_info.model}} |
| **Physical Cores** | {{cpu_info.physical_cores}} |
| **Logical Cores** | {{cpu_info.logical_cores}} |

&nbsp;
Current CPU Usage per logical core:
| Core Number | CPU Usage (%) |
|---|---|
{%- for core in cpu_info.per_core_usage %}
| {{core.core}} | {{core.usage_percent}} |
{%- endfor %}

## **GPU Information**
Here is the GPU information of the appliance, including the name and memory available on each GPU. If no GPU is present, it will indicate that no accelerator is available.

{% if gpu_info | length == 1 and gpu_info[0].description == "No accelerator present" %}
**{{ gpu_info[0].description }}**
{% else %}
| GPU Name | GPU Memory (MB)|
| ---|---|
{%- for gpu in gpu_info %}
| {{gpu.description}} | {{gpu.vram_mb}} |
{%- endfor %}

* **GPU Name**: The name of the GPU device.
* **GPU Memory**: The total memory available on the GPU in megabytes (MB).

## **Memory Information**
Here is the memory information of the appliance, including total, used, and free memory in megabytes (MB). The memory usage percentage is also calculated based on the used and total memory.

| Total Memory (MB) | Used Memory (MB) | Free Memory (MB) | Memory Usage (%) |
|---|---|---|
{% set percent = (ram_info.used_mb / ram_info.total_mb) * 100 %}
| {{ram_info.total_mb}} | {{ram_info.used_mb}} | {{ram_info.free_mb}} | {{ percent | round(1) }}% |

* **Total Memory**: Total physical memory available.
* **Used Memory**: Memory currently in use (excluding buff/cache).
* **Free Memory**: Completely unused memory.
* **Memory Usage**: Percentage of used memory relative to total memory.

This section provides detailed information about the mounted disks on the appliance, including their size, used space, free space, type, and mount point.

| Disk Name | Size | Used Space | Free Space | Type | Mount Point |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
{%- for disk in mounted_disks %}
| {{disk.device}} | {{disk.size}} | {{disk.used}} | {{disk.available}} | {{disk.type}} | {{disk.mountpoint}} |
{%- endfor %}

* **Disk Name**: The name of the disk device.
* **Size**: Total size of the disk.
* **Used Space**: Amount of space currently used on the disk.
* **Free Space**: Amount of space available on the disk.
